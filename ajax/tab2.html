		<p>Aerodynamically, the bumble bee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway.</p>
		<p>With a zeal to fly higher, started with a HAB ( Hot Air Balloon) which gave way to small RC planes finally leading to our very own quadropter. </p>
		<p>During the past few years, Team-Unwired has participated in many aero-modeling competitions and organized workshops like chuck gliders to encourage the young minds.</p>

		<p>A telescope and an open cloudless sky is the classroom for these nocturnal gazers who come out in the cold darkness of the night to explore the hidden secrets of the universe.</p>
		<p>Everyone might have seen the rings of saturn in textbooks and occassionally in the newspapers. Seeing it through your own telescope after meticulous adjustments and calibrations however is what is truly out of the world.</p>
                <p>We have two 90 mm Galilean telescopes and to involve our peer, star gazing and astrophotography nights are organised regularly.</p>

	<div class="main2">
	<p>Ever since a child first sees a car, it is his desire to drive one, to own one. With his little toys, he goes on his knees, pushing the car through rooms, revving his imaginary engine and loving every bit of it.</p>
<p>This love for automobiles is in all of us human beings. In varied proportions without doubt but definitely there. </p>
<p>Every little sound an engine makes, the squeal of burning rubber or the different sounds from an exhaust pipe, understanding these is now what could enthral us, members of teamunwired.</p>
<p>We have held exhibitions on cars ( called Wheels in Tathva, tech fest of NIT Calicut) and hope we got younger minds to keep their passion for cars alive and not just let go into the textbooks alone.</p>
<p>This is not mentioning the fact that we have already built both remote controlled and life size off road vahicles</p>

	 <p>It is possible to make a machine once, define its faults, rectify those while making a new machine, again find faults with the new measures and decide upon corrections and yet again make another one. the cycle could continue in the pursuit of perfection. </p>
<p>That might explain why inventions were a rarity in the olden days. In todays digital world, everything is made and tested virtually. There is no wastage of material or precious time.</p>
<p>Our club has a tradition of passing knowledge down to newcomers.  Our seniors took time out from their busy schedules to give us coaching on Solidworks DS. It is only with this tool that we were able to clear Virtual BAJA.</p>
<p>In Aakruti, a CAD competetion held by dassault systems, we ended up the first runner up, having presented the gearbox we designed and created for our previous BAJA project.</p>

		<p>Words and pictures can work together to communicate more powerfully than either alone.</p>
		<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. What better way of capturing our precious moments than photography itself?</p>
		<p>All photos in this website are the fruits of our club's photography skills.</p>

	<div class="main2">
			<p>Always looking to get our creations to challenge the cutting edge, books can be found piled up and dog-eared, complex equations broken and our own little theories cropping up as we build remote controlled aircrafts and amphibian transporters.</p>
<p>In IIST's technological fest( Conscientia), we got the second and third prize for the amphibian transporter  event(Salilsthalchar) and the robotics competition(Bots up). In NIT Trichy, we ended up first in the “NFS Aqua” remote controlled boat event.</p>
<p>There is nothing that enthralls us more than watching our little bots whirring through our workspace (we won the fourth prize in IIT Bombay's 2011 robo-polo) and our planes skimming the blue skies. We have built three remote controlled airplanes of our own, which have flown in various college technological fests like IITBombay's Techfest 2008 (18th position out of 120+ teams)</p>

	<div class="main2">
	<p>Rocketry was our first foray into the field of science as a hobby. It all began with Newton's third law, something we study in elementary school. Simple and beautiful being the concept, rocketry is what motivated us to actually try something out practically for the first time.</p>
<p>Once in college, it is the aerodynamics and the right propellant volume percentages for a fixed pressure that we brood over. Complex equations and pressure diagrams enter the foray. Patience is tested to the limit as we repeat our runs until optimum ratios are obtained.</p>
<p>In rocketry, we have conducted workshops for NIT students, competed and won the runners-up in bottle rocketry competition (Prakshepan) at IIST trivandrum.</p>

	<div class="main2">
	<p>Sharing information is vital in an organization. In ours, every action is the culmination of discussions in which each person puts forward his thought. When this is the order of functioning, it can turn into a very informal process, often without people being aware of what is actually happening.</p>
<p>Paathshaala started with the need for sharing a single video file. The potential of having a website dedicated to the sharing of information among fellow students appealed to us, not just in the altruistic manner but also since it would help learn the ways of the web</p>
<p>Paathshaala a place to learn and share information.It is a content sharing repository inside NIT Calicut. This project won a national database design competition by linux for you magazine. The project is opensourced and the source can be seen at <a href='https://github.com/nitcalicut/Paathshaala/' target='_blank'> github</a>.</p>
	Visit Paathshaala inside NITC Campus <a href='http://192.168.5.27/' target='_blank' >here</a>.
